- Prophet Forecast: This graph presents the overall forecast results. The black dots represent the actual observations, the blue curve represents the model's prediction, and the light blue area represents the confidence interval. The actual data shows that the indicator remained stable at a relatively low level for most of the time (mostly below 100,000), but there were several significant peaks, especially an unusually high peak of nearly 500,000 in the period from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020. The model's prediction curve is relatively gentle and failed to fully capture the magnitudes of these extreme peaks, but it attempts to reflect the overall baseline fluctuations. The prediction's confidence interval is wide, especially near the historical peaks.

- Forecast Components - Trend: This chart breaks down the long-term trend identified by the model. The trend line shows a continuous, smooth, and slightly accelerating non-linear growth from 2012 (approximately 18,000) to 2026 (approximately 65,000). This indicates that the benchmark level of this indicator shows a moderate but continuous upward trend over the long term.

- Annual Seasonality: This graph illustrates the annual seasonal patterns extracted by the model, with an impact range of -30% to +50%. The graph clearly shows the annual cycle: May is the peak activity period (close to +45%), with smaller increases in June-July, September, and November-December. February, March-April, and August are relatively low periods.

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This graph assesses the prediction accuracy of the model using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The X-axis represents the forecast period (Horizon, days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The blue line represents the overall higher and more fluctuating average MAPE value. Most of the time, it is between 0.3 and 1.0, and several significant peaks have appeared, such as when the forecast period is 350-400 days, the MAPE is close to 1.8, and at 650-750 days, it even reaches approximately 2.4. At the same time, the scattered gray points (single cross-validation errors) in the graph also show some extremely high error values.
