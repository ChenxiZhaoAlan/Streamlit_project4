### Destiny 2
- Prophet Forecast: This graph presents the overall forecast results. The black dots represent the actual observations, the blue curve represents the model's prediction, and the light blue area represents the confidence interval. The chart shows the high volatility of the indicator values, with multiple significant peaks (up to 250,000 - 300,000 or more) and troughs. The model attempts to capture these intense fluctuations and predicts that this high volatility state will continue in the future, but the prediction's confidence interval is very wide, reflecting the high uncertainty of the prediction.

- Forecast Components - Trend: This chart breaks down the long-term trend identified by the model. The trend line clearly shows a continuous and linear downward trend from the beginning of 2020 (approximately 128,000) to the middle of 2026 (approximately 62,000). This indicates that, despite significant short-term fluctuations, the benchmark level of this indicator gradually decreases over the long term.

- Annual Seasonality: This graph illustrates the annual seasonal patterns extracted by the model. The magnitude of the seasonal impact is extremely large, with the Y-axis ranging from -2500% to +2500%. There are several very strong annual peaks (such as +2000% near the end of February/Mid-March, and multiple peaks exceeding +1000% between June and August) and troughs (such as -1500% from the end of March to the beginning of April, and -2000% in early May) in the graph. This extreme seasonal pattern usually indicates that the model may interpret the explosive growth/decrease related to significant game updates, DLC releases, or specific events in history as fixed periodic events that occur annually.

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This graph assesses the prediction accuracy of the model using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The X-axis represents the forecast period (Horizon, in days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The chart shows that the MAPE values fluctuate greatly and the overall level is very high. For instance, during the forecast period of 130-160 days, the MAPE was close to 2.0 (200% error), and around 260 days, it soared to nearly 3.0 (300% error). Only before 130 days was the MAPE lower than 0.5 (50% error).
