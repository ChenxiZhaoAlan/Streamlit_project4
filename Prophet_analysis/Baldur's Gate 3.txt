- Prophet Forecast: This shows the overall prediction results. The black dots represent the actual observed data, the blue solid line is the model's prediction, and the light blue area represents the prediction's confidence interval (the range of uncertainty). The chart indicates that this indicator suddenly reached a huge peak (close to 600,000) in the middle of 2023 (approximately in August), then declined but remained at a relatively high level. The model attempts to capture this pattern and predicts that a peak may occur again in the future (such as at the end of 2025). Still, its confidence interval is extensive, especially near the peak and in long-term predictions, indicating that the prediction results have a significant amount of uncertainty.
  
- Forecast Components - trend: The long-term trend identified by the model has been separated. This trend line shows that from the beginning of 2021 to the end of 2026, the indicator exhibited a continuous and almost linear strong growth trend, starting from a negative value and steadily rising to approximately 340,000.

- Annual seasonality: Illustrates the annual seasonal patterns extracted by the model. The most notable feature is an exceptionally large positive seasonal effect that occurs after "July 1" each year (approximately from the end of July to the beginning of August), with an impact magnitude of nearly 4000%. This is highly likely to correspond to the official release of the game or a major annual event that triggers explosive growth. Additionally, the chart also shows smaller periodic fluctuations in other months.

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This is the cross-validation result of the model's prediction accuracy, using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as the evaluation metric. The X-axis represents the forecast period (Horizon, in days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The chart shows that the MAPE value is generally very high, mainly fluctuating between 5 and 13 (i.e., an error range of 500% to 1300%). Although there is a decrease in MAPE for specific short periods (such as 50-75 days), the overall error level remains exceptionally high.
