- Prophet Forecast: This graph presents the overall forecast results. The black dots represent the actual observations, the blue curve represents the model's prediction, and the light blue area represents the confidence interval. The chart shows that this indicator experienced rapid growth starting from 2012, peaked around 2016 (exceeding 1.2 million), then declined and fluctuated and stabilized at a lower level (approximately between 700,000 and 900,000). The model accurately captured the entire process of this growth, peak, decline, and stabilization period, and predicts that this stable fluctuation state will continue in the future.

- Forecast Components - Trend: This chart breaks down the long-term trend identified by the model. The trend line clearly depicts the life cycle of the indicator: it rose rapidly starting from 2012, reaching a peak of nearly 1 million in 2016; then the trend began to decline, and it gradually leveled off around 2020, stabilizing at approximately 750,000 and remaining at this level until the end of the forecast period.

- Annual Seasonality: This graph illustrates the annual seasonal patterns extracted by the model, with the impact ranging from -100% to +100%. The graph shows several significant annual fluctuations: there is a very strong peak from the end of February to the beginning of March (exceeding +70%), followed by a sharp trough from the end of March to the beginning of April (close to -80%); there is also a relatively obvious peak in mid-July of summer (about +45%); furthermore, the periods from the end of May to the beginning of June and from August to September are relatively low points.

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This graph assesses the prediction accuracy of the model using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The X-axis represents the forecast period (Horizon, days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The chart shows that the MAPE values are generally between 0.1 and 0.4 (i.e., an error of 10% to 40%). For shorter forecast periods (within 200 days), the MAPE is approximately between 0.12 and 0.18; as the forecast period lengthens, the MAPE shows a gradually increasing trend, reaching values around 0.3 to 0.4 for a forecast period of 800-900 days.
