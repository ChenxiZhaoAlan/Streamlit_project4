- Prophet Forecast: This graph presents the overall forecast results. The black dots represent the actual observations, the blue curve represents the model's prediction, and the light blue area represents the confidence interval. The chart demonstrates the high volatility of the indicator data, especially a significant peak (close to 250,000, accompanied by a outlier over 300,000) from the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020, and another notable rebound in early 2024. The model attempts to capture these intense fluctuations, but the prediction's confidence interval is very wide, and even its lower limit often falls below zero, reflecting the high uncertainty of the prediction.

- Forecast Components - trend: This graph decomposes the long-term trend identified by the model. The trend line clearly shows a continuous, linear decline from the beginning of 2018 (approximately 125,000) to the middle of 2026 (approximately 63,000). This indicates that, despite the significant short-term peaks, the benchmark level of this indicator gradually decreases over the long term.

- Yearly Seasonality: This graph shows the annual seasonal patterns extracted by the model. The amplitude of the seasonal influence is extremely large, with the Y-axis percentage ranging from -2000% to +2000%. There are multiple very strong annual peaks (such as +750% in early March, +800% in mid-April, and up to +1600% from the end of December to the beginning of the following January) and significant troughs (such as -800% in mid-January and -1750% in mid-February). This extreme seasonality usually indicates that the model may interpret the explosive growth/decrease related to major game updates, DLC releases, or specific activities in the past as fixed periodic events each year.

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This graph evaluates the model's prediction accuracy using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The X-axis represents the forecast period (Horizon, days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The chart shows that the MAPE values fluctuate wildly and are generally very high, often exceeding 1.0, with multiple peaks approaching or exceeding 1.5-2.0. Only for 180-300 days, the MAPE value is below 1.
