- Prophet Forecast: This graph presents the overall forecast results. The black dots represent the actual observations, the blue curve represents the model's prediction, and the light blue area represents the confidence interval. The chart shows that around March 2022 (possibly during the early stage of the game's release), the indicator reached a huge peak of nearly 1 million, and then quickly declined. Subsequently, the indicator fluctuated significantly at a lower level (mostly below 200,000) and accompanied by some secondary peaks (such as in early 2023 and early 2024). The model predicts that the future indicator will remain at a lower level and continue to fluctuate and decline, with a very wide confidence interval for the prediction.

- Forecast Components - Trend: This chart breaks down the long-term trend identified by the model. The trend line shows a continuous and steep linear downward trend starting from March 2022 (over 200,000), and it is expected that the trend value will turn negative by the beginning of 2026. This indicates that the benchmark level of the indicator has been showing a continuously declining trend after the peak of release.

- Annual Seasonality: This graph illustrates the annual seasonal patterns extracted by the model, with an extremely significant impact. The Y-axis ranges from -4000% to +3000%. There are multiple very strong annual peaks (such as multiple peaks exceeding +1500% from February to March, and several peaks close to +1800% from June to August) and notable troughs (such as approximately -1200% in early February, and a deep trough of -3500% in mid-May). This extreme seasonality usually indicates that the model may interpret a once-in-a-lifetime major event (such as a game release or a major DLC update) as a periodic phenomenon that occurs annually.

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This graph assesses the prediction accuracy of the model using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The X-axis represents the forecast period (Horizon, in days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The chart shows that the MAPE values fluctuate greatly and the overall level is very high. Except for the MAPE value being unexpectedly close to 0 for the forecast period around 80-90 days, the MAPE values for most other periods are significantly high. For example, in the forecast period of around 150 days, the MAPE soared to 2.0 (a 200% error), and other peaks are often around 1.0 (100% error).
