- Prophet Forecast: This graph presents the overall forecast results. The black dots represent the actual observations, the blue curve represents the model's prediction, and the light blue area represents the confidence interval. The chart shows that this indicator experienced explosive growth in 2017, reached an astonishing peak of over 3 million in early 2018, and then declined sharply. Since 2020, the indicator has stabilized at a lower level (approximately 500,000 - 1 million), but with strong seasonal fluctuations. And there are signs of a slight recovery in the actual data during 2023-2025. The model attempts to fit this complete life cycle, but the prediction confidence interval is very wide, especially during the historical peak period and the future prediction period.

- Forecast Components - Trend: This graph breaks down the long-term trend identified by the model. The trend line shows a continuous and steep linear downward trend starting from the beginning of 2017 (approximately 1.25 million), and is projected to drop to approximately 200,000 by 2026. This purely linear downward trend is a significant simplification of the complex pattern of "peak - sudden drop - stability - recent slight recovery" in the actual data, and fails to fully capture the stabilization period and the recent recovery of the actual benchmark level.

- Yearly Seasonality: This graph illustrates the annual seasonal patterns extracted by the model. The seasonal influence ranges from -60% to +60%, indicating a clear and significant annual cycle. The peak occurs at the beginning of each year (around January), exceeding +50%, while the trough is in the middle of the year (June-July), approaching -40%. It then gradually recovers and reaches another peak by the end of the year.

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This graph assesses the prediction accuracy of the model using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The X-axis represents the forecast period (Horizon, in days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The chart shows that the MAPE values are generally very high, and there is a clear and continuous upward trend as the forecast period lengthens. The MAPE for short-term predictions is close to 0.8 (80% error), rising to approximately 1.3 (130% error) at a 300-day forecast period, and approaching 2.0 (200% error) at a 600-day forecast period.
