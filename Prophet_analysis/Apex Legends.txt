- Prophet Forecast: The black dots represent the actual observations, the blue solid line represents the model's predicted values, and the light blue band represents the indicated confidence interval. From the graph, it can be seen that this indicator exhibits a fluctuating upward trend from 2021 to 2022, reaching a peak (approximately over 600,000) in early 2023. It then shows an overall fluctuating downward trend and is predicted to continue until 2026. The model captures certain seasonal fluctuations.
  
- Forecast Components - trend: It has broken down the trend component in the forecast. This curve shows the long-term trend more smoothly: it began to rise in 2021, reached its peak (above 500,000) in early 2023, then started to decline continuously, and by the end of 2026, it had approached zero. This explains the overall upward and downward trend direction shown in the first graph.

- yearly seasonality: Illustrates the annual seasonal patterns identified by the model. The Y-axis represents the percentage influence of this seasonal factor on the trend. It can be observed that at specific times of each year, the indicator fluctuates periodically above or below its trend value. For instance, there are annual peaks around February, September, and the end of October, while there are annual troughs around July and mid-November. Particularly, the negative impact in mid-November is very significant (close to -200%).

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This is the cross-validation result of the model's prediction accuracy, using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric. The X-axis represents the prediction period (Horizon, in days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The blue line shows that the MAPE generally increases as the prediction period extends, indicating that the further the prediction time, the greater the error may be. For example, the MAPE for short-term predictions (such as 50-100 days) is between 0.4 and 0.6, while when the prediction period exceeds 200 days, the MAPE rises above 1.0, suggesting that the error in long-term predictions is larger and the reliability is relatively lower.
