- Prophet Forecast: This graph presents the overall forecast results. The black dots represent the actual observations, the blue curve represents the model's prediction, and the light blue area represents the confidence interval. The chart shows that in early 2021 (possibly during the initial stage of the game's release), the indicator reached a huge peak of over 1 million, and then quickly declined. Subsequently, the indicator fluctuated at a lower level and reached a smaller secondary peak (around 250,000) at the end of 2023. The model predicts that the future indicator will remain at a lower level with certain fluctuations, but the confidence interval is relatively wide.

- Forecast Components - Trend: This chart breaks down the long-term trend identified by the model. The trend line shows that the indicator experienced an extreme peak in early 2021 and then dropped sharply, reaching a low point in early 2022. Subsequently, the trend rebounded and formed a gentle secondary trend peak (approximately 6-70,000) from the end of 2023 to the beginning of 2024. After that, it continued to decline and is expected to turn negative by the end of 2026.

- Annual Seasonality: This graph illustrates the annual seasonal patterns extracted by the model. The most notable feature is the extremely large magnitude of the seasonal impact, with the Y-axis percentage ranging from -4000% to +4000%. The graph shows multiple strong peaks within the year (such as at the end of February, the end of August/ beginning of September, and the end of December, with peaks reaching +1500% to +3500%) and troughs (such as in March, October, and November, with troughs reaching -2000% to -3500%). Such intense seasonality usually indicates that the model may interpret some one-off major events in history (such as releases, major updates, or promotions) as periodic events that occur annually.

- MAPE Cross-Validation: This graph assesses the prediction accuracy of the model using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The X-axis represents the forecast period (Horizon, in days), and the Y-axis represents the MAPE value. The chart shows that the MAPE values fluctuate greatly and are overall very high. For instance, around the forecast period of 80-90 days, the MAPE once exceeded 5 (i.e., a 500% error); in the 160-200 day forecast period, the MAPE also reached around 3.5.
