1. "Seasonal Decomposition" graph:

- Trend: Captures the long-term movement, mirroring the initial surge, subsequent overall decline, and minor upward movements.
- Seasonal: Displays an evident and strong cyclical pattern, indicating highly consistent recurring fluctuations within each year. The strong vertical lines suggest a consistent high-frequency seasonality.
- Resid (Residuals): It shows some remaining variability, particularly a noticeable fluctuation around late 2019/early 2020 and a dip in 2023, indicating factors not fully explained by the trend or strong seasonal components during those periods.

The ADF Statistic (-4.329) is significantly negative, and the p-value (0.00039) is extremely small, well below standard significance levels. It is well below the critical values at 1%, 5%, and 10% significance levels. This strongly suggests that the "Monster Hunter World" time series is stationary, indicating that its statistical properties remain stable over time.

2. ACF: Shows a very slow decay, with significant autocorrelation extending to many lags (well beyond 35 lags). This indicates a strong dependence between observations over time, consistent with the observed trend and strong seasonality. The slow decay suggests that even after accounting for trend and seasonality, strong correlations remain.

3. PACF: Exhibits a significant spike at lag 1, and then quickly drops to near zero and remains there for subsequent lags, with some minor negative spikes (e.g., around lag three and a broader negative section later on). This pattern primarily suggests that the direct correlation between an observation and a previous observation is strongest at lag 1. The rapid drop-off after lag 1 often points towards an AR(1) process or that the series can be made stationary with a single differencing step. The minor negative spikes might indicate some complex short-term or seasonal dependencies.
