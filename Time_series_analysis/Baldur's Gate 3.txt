1. "Seasonal Decomposition" graph:

- Trend: This panel isolates the game's underlying long-term movement. It clearly shows a flat trend during the Early Access period. Then, a dramatic, sudden surge corresponding to the game's full launch. This is followed by a sharp downward trend, stabilizing at a much lower, but still significant, player count. The "trend" here is less about gradual change and more about a rapid, step-function-like shift due to the release model.
- Seasonal: This panel extracts the regular, repeating patterns. There are consistent, prominent cyclical patterns visible throughout the entire graph. These are likely weekly or monthly cycles (e.g., higher player counts on weekends or during specific times of the month). The amplitude of these seasonal fluctuations appears consistent across the pre-launch and post-launch periods, though they are visually dwarfed by the massive launch spike in the "Peak" graph.
- Resid (Residuals / Noise): This panel shows the remaining irregular fluctuations. There's a relatively flat line of residuals for most of the graph, but a vast, concentrated spike of residuals precisely at the point of the game's full launch. This is because the decomposition model couldn't fully attribute such an extreme, sudden, and unprecedented surge to either a smooth trend or a regular seasonal pattern. It's an outlier event from the perspective of the model's regular patterns.

The p-value (0.00029) is much smaller than 0.05, and the ADF Statistic (-4.404) is less than the critical value at 1% (-3.43). This decomposition highlights that Baldur's Gate 3's player trend is overwhelmingly dominated by the massive, singular event of its full launch (seen as a sharp trend change and a significant residual spike). Beneath this, there are consistent regular (seasonal) patterns likely representing weekly or monthly player habits. The data is largely stable, which is confirmed by the ADF test, implying that while the launch was unique, the underlying patterns before and after it are relatively predictable for forecasting purposes.

2. ACF
This pattern suggests that while there is a strong immediate correlation (lag 1), the influence of past values doesn't persist as strongly as in a pure trend. The oscillating pattern suggests some cyclical behavior, but it's not a dominant, slow-decaying trend. This might reflect the sharp launch spike followed by a more regular pattern. This pattern is indicative of an autoregressive (AR) process, but not one dominated by a long-term trend.

3. PACF
The substantial spike at lag 1 in the PACF strongly suggests an AR(1) process. This means that the current value is primarily influenced by the immediately preceding value, after the effects of intermediate lags are removed.
